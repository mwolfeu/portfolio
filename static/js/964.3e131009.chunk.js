As faculty at The New School, I have taught electronics and coding for embedded hardware, multimedia frameworks and the web in both the Design and Technology and Communications departments. After receiving a MS in data visualization, I've worked with the UN to create resilient and accessible interfaces into the data that drive the organization's work in Africa's Sahel region. We are living in a time where data collection is cheap. Industry, governments, and private interests are sitting on vast troves of unused information.\n\n# Direction\n\nAs a data scientist, I seek to bridge the gap between the database and the end user. I'm captivated by jobs where I can create and deploy infrastructure to analyze, clean, and manipulate data structures, tell a powerful story, help great social causes, and assist underserved communities.\n",l=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,u=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return(0,d.jsx)(i.rU,(0,a.Z)({},t))};t.default=function(){return(0,d.jsx)(o.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Michael D'Angelo",children:(0,d.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,d.jsx)("header",{children:(0,d.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,d.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,d.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,d.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),(0,d.jsx)(s(),{source:c,renderers:{Link:u},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
